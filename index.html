        <div class="program_box">
          <div class=prog>
            <p>My first introduction to programming occurred while completing my B.S. degree in Geophysics at the University of Texas. Our programs contained advanced mathematics, such as fourier transforms, and MATLAB was the primary method for building them. Before becoming familiar with MATLAB, our professors had us write simple programs using the archaic FORTRAN language (first appeared in 1957). Although programming was not a critical component of my degree, I was able to get a glimpse into the creative and technical world of programming.</p><br></div>
          <div class=prog>
            <p>Four years into my career as a petroleum geologist the oil and gas industry had a sudden and drastic downturn. Like many of my friends and coworkers, I found myself out of work and feeling apprehensive about continuing a career with such volatility. Contemplating between the idea of grad school in a new field or transitioning into a new career, I reached out to friends in the tech industry for insight. Before making long-term decision, I decided to take a Python class on Coursera to gauge my aptitude for programming and instantly was intrigued. </p><br></div>
          <div class=prog>
            <p>Spending nearly all my free time on learning Python, I completed 8-week courses in a matter of days. After completing 5 Python and SQL courses I was convinced that programming would be a better career choice for me. However, I found myself unqualified for every entry-level job and realized attending a coding bootcamp was the next step for me. Curious of the front-end aspect of programming, I enrolled in the Austin Coding Academy at the beginning of July 2017 to start learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p></div>

        <h2 class="text-center">Personal Life</h2><br>
        <p>On most evenings you can find me rolling on the mats, practicing brazilian  jiu-jitsu with my friends and teammates. When I'm not programming or exercising, I'll likely be with friends, having a beer and soaking in the live music of downtown Austin. Half the time my dog Rocksy(my best friend) will be by my side, always keeping a lookout for other dogs to play with. Given the chance I will talk your ear off about pro basketball or how cool space is. If I'm nowhere to be found then I'm probably adventuring in a country, leaving my comfort zone and making memories along the way.</p>
